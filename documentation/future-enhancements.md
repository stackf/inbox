   - Implement retry logic for transient errors
   - Create error notification system to alert about failures

2. **Transaction Management**
   - Implement rollback capabilities for multi-step operations
   - Add checkpoints during email processing to prevent duplicate handling
   - Create state persistence for long-running operations

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Add rate limit awareness for all API calls
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries
   - Create queue system for high-volume operations

## Security Enhancements

1. **Tool Call Authentication**
   - Add JWT or HMAC authentication for tool endpoints
   - Implement request signing between OpenAI and tool endpoints
   - Add IP address whitelisting for external calls

2. **Credential Management**
   - Rotate API tokens automatically
   - Implement a secrets manager integration (e.g., Hashicorp Vault)
   - Add encryption for sensitive data in transit and at rest

3. **Permission Management**
   - Create granular permissions for different assistant operations
   - Implement least-privilege access principles
   - Add audit logging for all sensitive operations

## Monitoring & Observability

1. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Implement structured logging across all functions
   - Add correlation IDs for tracking requests across services
   - Create log aggregation and search capabilities

2. **Monitoring Dashboards**
   - Build admin dashboard for system health
   - Create visualization for assistant activity and performance
   - Implement anomaly detection for unusual patterns

3. **Alerting System**
   - Set up alerts for critical failures
   - Create SLO/SLA monitoring
   - Implement on-call rotation integration

## Feature Enhancements

1. **Email Classification Improvements**
   - Train custom classification models for email categorization
   - Implement feedback loop for misclassified emails
   - Add support for more complex filtering rules

2. **Conversation Memory**
   - Implement longer-term memory for assistant conversations
   - Create user preference tracking
   - Add conversation summarization for context retention

3. **Multi-User Support**
   - Add support for multiple email accounts
   - Implement user-specific preferences
   - Create team collaboration features

4. **Enhanced UI**
   - Build web dashboard for monitoring assistants
   - Create configuration interface for rules and preferences
   - Add visualization for email processing statistics

## Infrastructure Improvements

1. **Scalability**
   - Migrate to serverless architecture for all components
   - Implement queue-based processing for high-volume operations
   - Add horizontal scaling capabilities

2. **Testing Framework**
   - Create comprehensive unit test suite
   - Implement integration tests with API mocks
   - Add continuous integration and deployment pipeline

3. **Documentation**
   - Generate API documentation from code
   - Create user manual for administrators
   - Add runbooks for common operations and troubleshooting

## Integration Expansions

1. **Additional Email Providers**
   - Add support for Outlook/Microsoft 365
   - Implement support for IMAP/POP3 email sources
   - Create provider-agnostic email interface

2. **Additional Task Management Systems**
